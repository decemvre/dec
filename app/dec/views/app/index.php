	        	<p>It doesn't do much but it is a properly constructed MVC framework with clear separation of concerns. Since it's my first, it took almost 7 hours to code.</p>
	        	<p>An hour was wasted debugging the User model because I wrote it before I installed php-activerecord and since I've only ever worked with the Active Record in Yii2, the differences took a while to figure out.</p>
	        	<p>I could have written a Singleton database access object and used raw query instead, but I was curious about working with activerecord outside of an established framework.</p>
	        	<p>Of course, all user input which goes into the db needs to be sanitized to prevent sql injection and the form on the site itself should be protected against Cross-site request forgery as well as cross-site scripting, but there's only so much I can do in a few hours :D</p>
